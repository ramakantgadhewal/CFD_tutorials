# CFD_tutorials
Contains CFD cases which have been setup with OpenFOAM 2.2.x. The material, mostly related to fire scenarios and buoyancy driven flows, has been made for educational purposes for undergraduate/postgraduate students and engineers who are interested in CFD modeling. 

The tutorials are not validation cases, rather simple examples of how to setup up some fire-related scenarios. The tutorials may contain custom models (e.g., related to turbulence, combustion and radiation) and might require custom solvers that are not available in the default OpenFOAM version. 

Check https://github.com/pyrTriangle/CFD_papers for various journal publications related to the tutorials and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBqUSVif0o0aeptw82raveA for CFD videos of the tutorials.
