# CFD_tutorials
Contains CFD cases which have been setup with FireFOAM 2.2.x. The material, mostly related to fire scenarios and buoyancy driven flows, has been made for educational purposes for undergraduate/postgraduate students and engineers who are interested in CFD modeling. 

The tutorials are not validation cases, rather simple examples of how to setup up some fire-related scenarios. The tutorial may contain custom models (e.g., related to turbulence, combustion and radiation) that are not available in the default OpenFOAM versions.
